    "In this Jupyter notebook, we delve into a fascinating exploration of the relationship between coffee pricing and US inflation. Coffee, an integral part of daily life for millions worldwide, has a substantial economic impact. On the other hand, inflation, a key economic indicator, influences the purchasing power and general economic well-being of a nation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging data visualization, statistical analysis, and time series modeling, we aim to uncover potential correlations between coffee prices and inflation rates in the United States. This investigation could provide valuable insights into the underlying factors affecting coffee prices and their potential implications for the broader economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Join us on this data-driven journey to gain a deeper understanding of the intricate interplay between coffee pricing and inflation, and how these variables may impact each other in the dynamic landscape of economic fluctuations.\n",
